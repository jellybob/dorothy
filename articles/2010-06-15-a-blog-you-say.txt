title: A Blog, You Say?
date: 15/06/2010

Yes, a blog! I'm once again going to try writing regularly. Whether or not 
this descends into the usual deriliction of previous attempts we'll have to
see, but I'm hopeful.

I'm using a nice simple tool, in the shape of 
[Toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto) which is a very minimalist blogging
engine, in the hope that using nothing but plain text will help me to focus
more on writing, and less on endlessly tweaking things.

Topics to be covered include:

* Software development, particularly using Ruby
* Systems administration, focusing on automated infrastructures
* Games
* Cooking
* And a bit of everything else for good measure
