Given that my most popular post (by far) is about creating a new Rails 3 project
with Mongoid and the assorted extras you always end up needing. It's probably time
I updated it slightly.

Ignore everything said in there, and instead use this process:

    rails new APP_NAME -m http://railswizard.org/8ae846b8dc35319f5184.rb -T -O -J

[Rails Wizard](http://railswizard.org) was probably the best application to come
out of last year's Rails Rumble. It allows you to use a simple interface to build
templates for creating new Rails applications, and then add any extra commands you
want to run to the end.
