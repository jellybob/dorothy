Since it was a bank holiday today I decided it was about time that I released a
small project I've been working on for a while now. I'd had a couple of pull requests
for it on GitHub already, and so I figured if other people were using and patching it,
it was probably due for release.

I present to the world [activo-rails](http://rubygems.org/gems/activo-rails/). A Rails
engine designed to make using [Activo](http://github.com/dmfrancisco/activo/) a more
pleasurable process. I've been using the theme on a few projects recently, and decided
I'd had enough of butchering the example page to get to a decent starting point.

The Big Features
----------------

  * View helpers for menus, breadcrumbs, and controls.
  * A customisable layout.
  * The [FatCow icon set](http://fatcow.com/free-icons).

There's more I'd like to add, but as a 1.0, I think this is probably enough.
