title: Hubbub Are Hiring
date: 16/02/2012
category: Work

Since the middle of last year I've been working full time for [Hubbub](http://www.hubbub.co.uk), a company which is supporting local independent food shops
by providing home delivery services, allowing customers to buy great food even if they're not able to get to the shops during the day. I've been having a
fabulous time, they've got a great team, and I've learnt more about food in the last 6 months then I ever knew before starting!

We're expanding now, and to do so we need another developer. That's where you come in. If you want to work for a startup which is actually changing things
that matter, instead of letting you share pictures of kittens in a slightly different way, we want to talk to you.

The full job description can be found on [our website](http://www.hubbub.co.uk/pages/web-developer), but here's the bullet points:

* Our platform is built with Rails, running on Linux servers.
* You'll be working on the whole stack, from servers to CSS.
* We're looking for a problem solver, not just a coder.
* Flexible working is an option. I work 4 days a week, 3 of which are from home.
* Perks include [free lunch](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23lunchtweet%20from%3Ahubbubtweets) when you're in the office, and discounted food.

If that lot interests you, send an email to info@hubbub.co.uk with the subject line "Web Developer" letting us know why you want to work for us, and why we
should want to work with you.
