title: Copycat, a tool for editing copy.

*TLDR; I wrote an Open Source version of Copycopter's server called Copycat. You can find it on GitHub at
http://github.com/jellybob/copycat.*

The last couple of days I've been writing a Sinatra applications which I plan to use for managing copy on
my client's web applications. It's not a full blown content management system, it's just enough to allow 
clients to change the titles of pages and the like by themselves.

If you're familiar with [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com) then that might sound like something you've heard
of before. If you're not, you probably havn't seen [Copycopter](http://copycopter.com), which is a tool with
almost exactly that description, and a very neat client gem which synchronises your application's translations
with the Copycopter web interface.

When I tried it out I found that while I love the client, I was less then enamoured with the web interface, which
I just couldn't see most of my clients using... "What's datetime.distance_in_words.about_x_hours.other, and why would
I want to edit it?" they might say

I also wasn't thrilled with the idea of paying them between $10 and $45 per month for the privilege of using it. Call
me cheap if you like, but it just didn't seem worth it.

What did seem worth it was learning a bit more about Sinatra and Redis, which seemed like the right set of tools to be
using for this particular job. If ever there were a job for a key/value store, this is probably it. And so I set about
building it.

And now you can use it as well. You'll find it on [GitHub](http://github.com/jellybob/copycat). It'll run on Heroku, it'll even
run on Heroku for free if you don't have that much data (and back it up, there's no persistence guarantees on Redis to Go's
Nano plan). The web interface is a little rough around the edges still, but it does work, and it's really quick thanks to 
[PJAX](https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax).
