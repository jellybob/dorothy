title: Template Naming for ActionMailer 3

When naming templates for ActionMailer 3 remember that the naming format has changed.

Templates used by in the form `method.text.plain.erb` and `method.text.html.erb`. They
now take the form `method.text.erb` and `method.html.erb`.

This bit me with a lot of frustration, since it won't automatically render the the old 
form. I only realised what was happening when I tried to manually render it and got a
deprecation warning in the logs.
