title: Installing an Ubuntu 10.04 Server Under VirtualBox

When installing Ubuntu 10.04 Server as a VirtualBox VM, don't use the 
"Install Minimal Virtual Machine" option in the installer options.

Strangely, that causes installing it as a VM to fail spectacularly, with
the boot loader failing to find any hard disks. A standard install seems
to work fine.
